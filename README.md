# Sports Dashboard: EC2 Deployment

This repo assumes itself to be cloned to the directory `/home/ubuntu/sd-ec2/`. It requires [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-ansible-on-ubuntu) to be installed.

To deploy the server for the first time, run `(cd /home/ubuntu/sd-ec2/scripts; sudo sh ./playbook.sh)`. Later deployment should be done through the portal.

Requires **Ubuntu 18.04** or later to run Node 16 and PHP 8.
